Once Binder has launched, you should see the Jupyter Notebook Dashboard with two example GMPL Notebook files:

* 0 Solving Linear Programs with GMPL Notebook.ipynb

Click their names to open these notebooks in a new browser tab.

You can also start your own GMPL Notebook file by clicking __New > GMPL/MathProg__ in the Dashboard.

Enjoy!
